# Confluence
This is a simple Confluence API client that came about as a result of repetive task I needed to perform.

# Usage
The main method of the `confluence-client.py` needs to be updated to suite your needs and the code should be executed as below.
<pre> python confluence-client.py config.json </pre>

This code was run on `Python 2.7` and `Ubuntu 16.04`. It was tested on `Confluence 6.0.3`
